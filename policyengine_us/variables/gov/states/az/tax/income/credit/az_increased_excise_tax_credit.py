# 2. Should I remove "federal"?

# Some details that don't include in the coding:
# 1. valid SSN for employement
# 2. prison issues
# 3. You are not claimed as a dependent by any other taxpayer
# 4. The credit cannot exceed $100 per household. Do not claim this credit if someone else in your household has already claimed $100 of the credit. If someone else in your household has claimed less than $100, you may claim the credit as long as all credit claims filed from your household do not exceed $100
